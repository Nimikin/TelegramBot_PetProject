# TelegramBot_PetProject

### Tools:
- Maven
- Java 11
- Spring Boot
- [Spring Email](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-email)
- [Apache Commons Validator](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-validator/commons-validator/1.7) for url validation
- TelegramBot library for [Java](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots)

This bot was created to build an order and send it to your email. 
The idea of `ConversationStates` I took from [here](https://github.com/tarasvladyka/volunteer-telegram-bot)
